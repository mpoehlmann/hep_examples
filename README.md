# hep_examples
High energy physics examples and tutorials.

## Overview
I'm a PhD student studying experimental high energy physics (HEP) with a focus on rare event detection.
In my free time, I have compiled examples of analysis macros, code snippets, and other coding knowledge which I think are useful.
My hope is to help HEP students who have some coding experience to quickly become more proficienct.
Feel free to let me know if you discover any bugs or have requests for specific examples.

This tutorial is divided into the following chapters:
1. **Introduction**
  - Getting started with ``bash``
  - Setting up computing environment
2. **Basic ``C/C++``, ``Python``, and ``Julia``**
3. **ROOT**
4. **Geant4**
5. **Advanced Python**
  - Speed up code with ``numba``
  - HEP analysis with ``uproot`` and ``awkward-array`` packages
6. **Machine Learning**
  - Applications and examples for machine learning in HEP
